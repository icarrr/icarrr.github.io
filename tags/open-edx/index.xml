        <description>I&amp;rsquo;m using Open edX relase ironwood.master (installed by 2020), i can&amp;rsquo;t hide the course from all users after chage course visibility from Advanced settings in the studio.
If this is also the case with you, you can fix it by following these steps:
  Login to server, and edit lms.env.json in /edx/app/edxapp or lms.yml in /edx/etc if you are using Open edX release juniper or latest.
  Find COURSE_CATALOG_VISIBILITY_PERMISSION and change the value with see_in_catalog.</description>

        <description>Apart from the issue user celery does not exist after migrated or upgrade the instance, there are other possible issues that may be encountered after migrating instances, i.e. service notifier-celery-workers failed to start (FATAL, Exited too quickly).
Issue notifier-celery-workers failing to start may be encountered after migrate the instances because before migration, the service has not been turned off while the service is serving several transactional queries so the database used by the service is locked (especially if you are still using SQLite), which means that the service cannot read or write data to the database.</description>

        <description>Account lockout feature will keep track of the number of failed login attempts on a given user&amp;rsquo;s email. If the number of consecutive failed login attempts - without a successful login at some point - reaches a configurable threshold (default 5), then the account will be &amp;ldquo;locked&amp;rdquo; for a configurable amount of seconds (15 minutes) which will prevent additional login attempts until this time period has passed. If a user successfully logs in, all the counter which tracks the number of failed attempts will be reset back to 0.</description>

        <description>When setup course in Open edX, you can use some of default components that can help or support the learning process. But maybe you also need additional components which are not provided by Open edX by default, the component is called XBlock. You can make this XBlock and then install it on the Open edX server or you can also install XBlock that has been made by other people according to your needs.</description>

Following are the steps you need to take if you want the uploaded files to be stored on the Open edX server.
 Open dan edit file /edx/app/edxapp/edx-platform/lms/envs/common.py, then add the following syntax.  ### ORA2 filesystem settings ORA2_FILEUPLOAD_BACKEND = &amp;#34;filesystem&amp;#34; ORA2_FILEUPLOAD_CACHE_NAME= &amp;#34;default&amp;#34; ORA2_FILEUPLOAD_ROOT = os.</description>

        <description>In most cases, you&amp;rsquo;ll want learners to be able to claim certificates for themselves on the progress page. For self-paced courses, this is already done! You&amp;rsquo;re good to go. For instructor-led courses, however, you&amp;rsquo;ll need to Enable Student-Generated Certificates.
To allowing learners to claim their own certificates, do the following steps:
  Login to LMS as admin or staff.
  On the learning site dashboard page, open one of the existing courses.</description>

To enable certificates, you modify the lms.env.json and cms.env.json files.

If it does not exist already, create the folder /tmp/certificates owned by the user and group www-data.</description>

        <description>By default, after user login into LMS, user cannot see the homepage. They always redirected to their dashboard.
What if i want to set user can see the homepage, even after they are logged in?
This can be set in lms.env.json, by putting this config inside block ”FEATURES” :
&amp;quot;ALWAYS_REDIRECT_HOMEPAGE_TO_DASHBOARD_FOR_AUTHENTICATED_USER&amp;quot;: false
After that, restart your edxapp lms service to see the changes.
Thats it. Now you can see the homepage after user logged in.</description>

        <description>By default in Open edX, the system will send an email when a new user registers, using the forget password or other conditions.
A few days ago my teams found an issue on the email sending service, but the issue was not because of the Open edX SMTP service but from the connection side of the Open edX server to the SMTP server.
Then what&amp;rsquo;s the case?
Case:

        <description>Beberapa hari yang lalu saya memindahkan instance Open edX dan beberapa menit setelah server aktif, Open edX tidak bisa diakses. Cek servicenya, tetapi semua service dalam keadaan aktif namun ketika melihat lognya, ternyata ada error pada celery, kurang lebih errornya seperti berikut:
$ sudo tail -f /edx/var/log/{lms,cms,nginx}/*log ==&amp;gt; /edx/var/log/lms/edx.log &amp;lt;== Apr 12 02:21:16 beep [service_variant=lms][celery.worker.consumer][env:sandbox] ERROR [beep 1400] [consumer.py:364] - consumer: Cannot connect to amqp://celery:**@127.0.0.1:5672//: [Errno 104] Connection reset by peer.</description>

        <description>By default Open edX does not provide an SSL configuration, but we can add it manually. As per the topic of this article, here I will enable HTTPS on Open edX using Certbot.
Certbot is a new breakthrough from the Let&amp;rsquo;s Encrypt Web Security Certificate Provider where Lets Encrypt provides SSL for free.

        <description>What is the problem? Ficus is a name of Open edX release which was released on February 23, 2017.

Last September, my friends asked me to install Open edX Ficus, because it&amp;rsquo;s an old version so I tried to install it in another VM, I made a VM on the Google Cloud Platform.</description>

To format your text input problem to accept any response, assign the answer attribute as follows: answer=&amp;quot;.*.&amp;quot;.
