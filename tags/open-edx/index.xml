        <description>What is the problem? Ficus is a name of Open edX release which was released on February 23, 2017. It&#39;s been quite a long time, and automatically uses old packages or packages that are still active at that time. Last September, my friends asked me to install Open edX Ficus, because it&#39;s an old version so I tried to install it in another VM, I made a VM on the Google Cloud Platform.</description>
