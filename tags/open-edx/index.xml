        <description>Setting up Sentry crash reporting if you want to provide a reliable service, it’s extremely important to be aware of when things are going wrong on the website.
Sentry is a wonderful free system to catch Python exceptions.
For Django on Open edX, we use sentry-sdk to catch and report the errors back to Sentry.
Set up a Sentry server or use existing Sentry .
Set up two new services (LMS and Studio) in Sentry and get their DSN strings.</description>

        <guid>https://sibunglon.com/2022/08/18/storage-backing-for-blockstructurestore/</guid>
        <description>When the user access the course, there is a request trying to access BlockStructure (BS) data in Memcache and when it is not found in the cache, the system enters Collect Mode, and the process is quite heavy and causes slower response times.
The maximum size of Memcache is 1 MB so if the BS is bigger than that Memcache will not save it.
The solution to the BS issue against Memcache is to enable storage backing, be it local storage or Amazon S3 storage.</description>

Issue notifier-celery-workers failing to start may be encountered after migrate the instances because before migration, the service has not been turned off while the service is serving several transactional queries so the database used by the service is locked (especially if you are still using SQLite), which means that the service cannot read or write data to the database.</description>

        <description>By default, after user login into LMS, user cannot see the homepage. They always redirected to their dashboard.
What if i want to set user can see the homepage, even after they are logged in?
This can be set in lms.env.json, by putting this config inside block ”FEATURES” :
&amp;quot;ALWAYS_REDIRECT_HOMEPAGE_TO_DASHBOARD_FOR_AUTHENTICATED_USER&amp;quot;: false
After that, restart your edxapp lms service to see the changes.
Thats it. Now you can see the homepage after user logged in.</description>

Then what&amp;rsquo;s the case?
