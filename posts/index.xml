Ya emang menarik, agar user tidak perlu memasukkan password jika ingin mendapatkan hak akses root cukup tambahkan si user ke sudoers.
Bermain dengan Sudoers 1) Edit file sudoers dengan command nano /etc/sudoers.
2) Setelah berhasil mengakses file sudoers, sekarang tambahkan sintaks berikut:
sibunglon ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL Note: Kata sibunglon diganti sesuai user yang akan diberikan izin menggunakan sudo tanpa password.
Sekarang user sibunglon (user sesuai yang anda daftarkan) dapat menggunakan command sudo tanpa password.</description></item><item><title>Menonaktifkan Plugin Terminal Dari Cockpit</title><link>https://sibunglon.com/2018/12/23/menonaktifkan-plugin-terminal-dari-cockpit/</link><pubDate>Sun, 23 Dec 2018 00:14:35 +0700</pubDate><guid>https://sibunglon.com/2018/12/23/menonaktifkan-plugin-terminal-dari-cockpit/</guid><description>Cockpit Apa sih cockpit itu?

Cockpit berjalan di port 9090, tidak membutuhkan web server jadi jika anda belum menginstall web server apapun, itu tidak menjadi masalah, serta resource yang digunakan cockpit sangat sedikit karena service cockpit akan dijalankan secara otomatis jika anda mencoba mengaksesnya melalui web page dan setelah beberapa menit setelah anda logout secara otomatis service cockpit akan di matikan.</description></item><item><title>Berkenalan Dengan Let's Encrypt SSL Gratis Untuk Nginx</title><link>https://sibunglon.com/2018/12/16/berkenalan-dengan-lets-encrypt-ssl-gratis-untuk-nginx/</link><pubDate>Sun, 16 Dec 2018 07:51:58 +0700</pubDate><guid>https://sibunglon.com/2018/12/16/berkenalan-dengan-lets-encrypt-ssl-gratis-untuk-nginx/</guid><description>Let&amp;rsquo;s Encrypt?

Mudahkan kalau caranya cuman gitu? :D Tapi jika masih ada yang bingung, tenang labnya masih saya bagikan.

DNS yaitu kepanjangan dari Domain Name System merupakan sebuah server yang berfungsi menangani translasi penamaan host-host kedalam IP Address, begitu juga sebaliknya dalam menangani translasi dari IP Address ke Hostname/Domain. Lebih mudahnya DNS dapat diartikan sebagai sebuah layanan yang digunakan untuk menterjemahkan hostname/domain ke IP Address atau sebaliknya.</description></item><item><title>Membuat Repositori Debian 8 Dari Iso DVD</title><link>https://sibunglon.com/2017/10/24/membuat-repositori-debian-8-dari-iso-dvd/</link><pubDate>Tue, 24 Oct 2017 02:54:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sibunglon.com/2017/10/24/membuat-repositori-debian-8-dari-iso-dvd/</guid><description>A.

Pendahuluan
Pada kesempatan kali ini, saya akan memposting tentang pengimplemtasian routing static di mikrotik
B. Pengertian
Routing static adalah menambahkan jalur routing tertentu secara manual. Mikrotik secara default akan membuat jalur routing otomatis (dynamic route) ketika kita menambahkan ip address pada interface. Lalu kenapa kita memerlukan static routing? Karena untuk menghubungkan perangkat network yang memilik ip segment (subnet) yang berbeda memerlukan sebuah perangkat yang mampu melakukan proses static routing.</description></item><item><title>Routing Dynamic RIP di MikroTik</title><link>https://sibunglon.com/2017/09/15/routing-dynamic-rip-di-mikrotik/</link><pubDate>Fri, 15 Sep 2017 02:05:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sibunglon.com/2017/09/15/routing-dynamic-rip-di-mikrotik/</guid><description>A.

B. Pengertian
Routing Information Protocol (RIP) adalah sebuah protokol routing dinamis yang digunakan dalam jaringan LAN (Local Area Network) dan WAN (Wide Area Network). Oleh karena itu protokol ini diklasifikasikan sebagai Interior Gateway Protocol (IGP). Protokol ini menggunakan algoritma Distance-Vector Routing. Pertama kali didefinisikan dalam RFC 1058 (1988). Protokol ini telah dikembangkan beberapa kali, sehingga terciptalah RIP Versi 2.</description></item><item><title>Training Entri Data Bersama Manis PT.Ebizu #day2</title><link>https://sibunglon.com/2017/09/14/training-entri-data-bersama-manis-pt.ebizu-#day2/</link><pubDate>Thu, 14 Sep 2017 02:01:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sibunglon.com/2017/09/14/training-entri-data-bersama-manis-pt.ebizu-#day2/</guid><description>PENDAHULUAN
