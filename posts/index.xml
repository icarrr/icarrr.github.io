        <description>Setting up Sentry crash reporting if you want to provide a reliable service, it’s extremely important to be aware of when things are going wrong on the website.
Sentry is a wonderful free system to catch Python exceptions.
For Django on Open edX, we use sentry-sdk to catch and report the errors back to Sentry.
Set up a Sentry server or use existing Sentry .
Set up two new services (LMS and Studio) in Sentry and get their DSN strings.</description>

        <description>When the user access the course, there is a request trying to access BlockStructure (BS) data in Memcache and when it is not found in the cache, the system enters Collect Mode, and the process is quite heavy and causes slower response times.
The maximum size of Memcache is 1 MB so if the BS is bigger than that Memcache will not save it.
The solution to the BS issue against Memcache is to enable storage backing, be it local storage or Amazon S3 storage.</description>

        <description>Usually issues are found because there are some dependencies that are required but not installed yet. Make sure libmysqlclient-dev is installed, also check the /usr/include/mysql directory to make sure the file my_config.h does not exist like the message on the log.
For the case I&amp;rsquo;ve found, the file my_config.h is not in the /usr/include/mysql directory and for fixing it use the following command:
$ cd /usr/include/mysql $ sudo wget https://raw.</description>

        <description>Apart from the issue user celery does not exist after migrated or upgrade the instance, there are other possible issues that may be encountered after migrating instances, i.e. service notifier-celery-workers failed to start (FATAL, Exited too quickly).
Issue notifier-celery-workers failing to start may be encountered after migrate the instances because before migration, the service has not been turned off while the service is serving several transactional queries so the database used by the service is locked (especially if you are still using SQLite), which means that the service cannot read or write data to the database.</description>

        <description>By default, after user login into LMS, user cannot see the homepage. They always redirected to their dashboard.
What if i want to set user can see the homepage, even after they are logged in?
This can be set in lms.env.json, by putting this config inside block ”FEATURES” :
&amp;quot;ALWAYS_REDIRECT_HOMEPAGE_TO_DASHBOARD_FOR_AUTHENTICATED_USER&amp;quot;: false
After that, restart your edxapp lms service to see the changes.
Thats it. Now you can see the homepage after user logged in.</description>

        <description>By default in Open edX, the system will send an email when a new user registers, using the forget password or other conditions.
A few days ago my teams found an issue on the email sending service, but the issue was not because of the Open edX SMTP service but from the connection side of the Open edX server to the SMTP server.
Then what&amp;rsquo;s the case?
Case:
-) When a user registers, the user should receive an email to activate the account, but in reality it is not.</description>

        <description>A few days ago, one of the servers used by my worker&amp;rsquo;s developer friends often experienced a down (assumed to be server A). Initially I thought it was caused by the very few available server resources and increasing number of processes carried out by applications.
When checking server resources, it turns out that CPU usage has reached 100%.
What process continues to make CPU usage up to 100%? Whereas on other servers (assumed to be server B) with the same application process, CPU usage does not reach 100%.</description>

        <description>What is the problem? Ficus is a name of Open edX release which was released on February 23, 2017. It&amp;rsquo;s been quite a long time, and automatically uses old packages or packages that are still active at that time. Last September, my friends asked me to install Open edX Ficus, because it&amp;rsquo;s an old version so I tried to install it in another VM, I made a VM on the Google Cloud Platform.</description>

        <description>Has anyone ever done a postgres database backup using the pg_dump command line and then found problems with messages more or less like the following?
pg_dump: server version: 9.6.12; pg_dump version: 9.2.24 pg_dump: aborting because of server version mismatch At that time I used Postgres 9.6.
If before you did not do the postgres installation process, when backing up the data and finding problems with the message more or less like what I show then do not be too quick to ambition to make postgres or other improvements because it requires a great effort especially if the problem is found in production server, DANGER 🤣 Simply find the pg_dump command line location according to the postgres version of the server being used.</description>

        <description>Caddy? Gak usah takut 😆 beberapa bulan yang lalu kan udah kenalan sama si Caddy dan ini postnya, tapi waktu itu kan cuman sekedar berkenalan. Nah dipostingan ini I&amp;rsquo;m siBunglon akan memberikan step installasinya di linux beserta memamerkan fitur yang paling sering I&amp;rsquo;m siBunglon pakai jika menggunakan si Caddy ini. To the point aja yah, kan kenalannya udah :D
Bermain Dengan Caddy 1) Install caddy ke sistem dengan command
curl https://getcaddy.</description>

Disuatu waktu I&amp;rsquo;m siBunglon menemukan masalah pada saat akan melakukan installasi package dari python-pip, paketnya tidak bisa diinstall tapi diwaktu itu I&amp;rsquo;m siBunglon menggunakan koneksi yang dikelola oleh orang lain dan mencoba browsing eh ternyata lancar jaya, mencoba menggunakan Wi-Fi dari device yang lain dan masalah tersebut tidak muncul.</description>

        <description>Hotspot Sistem Voucher Layaknya wifi.id Pada era informatika sekarang ini, bisnis hotspot sangat menggiurkan karena penggunaan dan kebutuhan internet masyarakat Indonesia sangat meningkat. Internet seperti sudah menjadi kebutuhan primer bagi masyarakat perkotaan bahkan pedesaan. Oleh karena itu menurut saya, bisnis hotspot sangat menjanjikan untuk dijalankan di desa maupun di kota.
Namun saat ini masih banyak bisnis hotspot tidak dimanajemen dengan baik. Kenapa saya bilang begitu? Masih ada pemilik bisnis hotspot memasang tarif koneksi per 1 device, namun autentikasi yang digunakan cuman menggunakan WPA2 Personal.</description>

Pernah gak sih kalian berpikir untuk memisahkan traffic suatu layanan dijaringan lokal atau mungkin diantara pembaca sudah ada yang telah berkenalan atau mendengarkan tentang pemisahan traffic? Contohnya untuk jaringan di Warung Kopi (Warkop), sekolah, kantor, taman, dll.
Semakin hari kebutuhan akan manajemen jaringan semakin beragam. Hal ini tidak lepas dari semakin beragam pula layanan internet yang ada. Diasumsikan sebagai penyedia layanan akses internet, kalian pasti ingin memberikan layanan yang terbaik ke semua client.</description>

Melalui postingan beberapa hari yang lalu kita telah berkenalan secara kilat dengan ansible, saya kira postingan sebelumnya sudah cukup membantu dan mengantar kita untuk kepo kepo i si Ansible tersebut. Sesuai apa yang ada di web resminya, disana kita bisa lihat bahwa si Ansible mempunyai banyak module yang bisa digunakan bahkan dikembangkan.
Diantara banyak module yang disediakan berdasarkan apa yang saya ketahui setelah berkenalan dengan si Ansible, ada 2 module yang bisa digunakan untuk mengirim pemberitahuan yaitu module sendgrid dan telegram.</description>

Bayangkan jika sekarang kalian disuruh melakukan hal tersebut untuk 15 sampai 50 server, mabok dan bete auto mode ON hihihi :v Apalagi kalau sistem operasinya berbeda beda, mungkin baru dengar aja seketika mabok dan bete udah auto ganti ke mode ON.</description>

        <description>Ansible? Apa itu ansible? Untuk apa dia datang?
Daripada banyak nanya hayuuuk berkenalan aja dengan ansible.
Ansible adalah tool automation yang dimiliki oleh perusahaan yang bergerak dibidang teknologi yaitu RedHat. Ansible adalah perangkat lunak open source yang mengotomatiskan pemasangan software, manajemen konfigurasi, dan beberapa tugas lainnya. Ansible terhubung dengan client remotenya menggunakan ssh.
Apa Kelebihan Ansible? Karena beberapa hari belakangan ini saya sebagai siBunglon telah mencobanya, maka dari itu siBunglon paparkan kelebihan penggunaaan ansible versinya sendiri :v hihihi</description>

        <description>Login SSH Tanpa Password Plain Text? Login ssh tanpa password plain text? emang bisa? terus loginnya pake apa? cuman modal username aja?
Ya, kali ini labnya tentang gimana caranya agar nantinya kalian dapat login ke server masing-masing tapi gak pakai password plain text lagi. Ya itu bisa saja terjadi, setelah menonaktifkan autentikasi password nanti kita login ke server masing-masing menggunakan private keynya sesuai pada lab sebelumnya. Jika autentikasi password plain text pada login ssh di nonaktifkan, agar bisa login ke server yang dibutuhkan cuman private key, username, ip atau domain server yang dituju.</description>

        <description>Akses Server Dengan Autentikasi Private Key Ssh Login Ke Server Dengan Private Key? Emang bisa? Ya itu bisa.
Umumnya server diakses menggunakan ssh dengan autentikasi password plain text, jika cuman akses 1 server dengan autentikasi password plain text itu masih biasa namun jika mengontrol banyak server dan passwordnya berbeda-beda, apakah anda masih siap mengingatnya? Apakah anda yakin ingin mencatatnya? Jika anda mencatatnya anda bisa saja masih repot karena harus mendefinisikan satu per satu hostname server beserta passwordnya.</description>

        <description>Sudo Tanpa Password? Hmmm kelihatannya menarik.
Ya emang menarik, agar user tidak perlu memasukkan password jika ingin mendapatkan hak akses root cukup tambahkan si user ke sudoers.
Bermain dengan Sudoers 1) Edit file sudoers dengan command nano /etc/sudoers.
2) Setelah berhasil mengakses file sudoers, sekarang tambahkan sintaks berikut:
sibunglon ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL Note: Kata sibunglon diganti sesuai user yang akan diberikan izin menggunakan sudo tanpa password.
Sekarang user sibunglon (user sesuai yang anda daftarkan) dapat menggunakan command sudo tanpa password.</description>

        <description>Cockpit Apa sih cockpit itu?
Pertanyaan sejenis itu sudah di tulis pada lab sebelumnya, karena di lab sebelumnya kita awali perkenalan dulu :D Kali aja jatuh cinta sama teman baru, kan gak enak kalau sebelumnya gak kenalan dulu :D
Oh ya mungkin ada yang kepikiran tentang keamanan server jika memasang cockpit di server dan memberikan akses role user yang dapat mengontrol systemD, karena secara default cockpit mengaktifkan plugin terminal. Dengan adanya terminal/shell, user yang login ke cockpit dengan role super user atau sudo bisa saja melakukan diluar sepengetahuan anda.</description>

        <description>Cockpit? Apa sih cockpit itu? Bukannya cockpit itu ruang khususnya pilot?
Cockpit adalah sebuah aplikasi adminstrasi server berbasi web. Dengan cockpit, grafik penggunaan cpu, memory, network, hdd dapat dilihat langsung pada saat autentikasi user cockpit berhasil serta dapat mengontrol service yang dijalankan melalui SystemD.
Cockpit berjalan di port 9090, tidak membutuhkan web server jadi jika anda belum menginstall web server apapun, itu tidak menjadi masalah, serta resource yang digunakan cockpit sangat sedikit karena service cockpit akan dijalankan secara otomatis jika anda mencoba mengaksesnya melalui web page dan setelah beberapa menit setelah anda logout secara otomatis service cockpit akan di matikan.</description>

        <description>Let&amp;rsquo;s Encrypt? Apa sih let&amp;rsquo;s encrypt itu?
Let&amp;rsquo;s encrypt adalah certificate Authority (CA) atau otoritas sertifikat yang menyediakan cara mudah untuk mendapatkan dan menginstall SSL pada web server, sehingga memungkinkan web server anda terenskripsi (HTTPS). Merupakan layanan yang disediakan oleh Internet Security Research Group (ISRG). ISRG memberikan dan mengaktifkan HTTPS secara gratis dengan alasan ingin menciptakan web yang lebih aman dan menjaga privasi. Sebenarnya untuk mendapatkan dan memasang SSL itu memiliki biaya sendiri namun jika untuk kebutuhan pengembangan, ngoprek / ngelab, let&amp;rsquo;s encrypt ini menjadi solusi.</description>

        <description>Subdomain? Subdomain adalah bagian dari nama domain induk yang memiliki ruangan sendiri (direktori), mengacu ke suatu alamat fisik. Contohnya subdomain blog.sibunglon.com acuannya yaitu sibunglon.com. Jika menggunakan nginx, untuk membuat subdomain sama seperti pada lab sebelumnya yang Bermain Dengan Nginx. Mudahkan kalau caranya cuman gitu? :D Tapi jika masih ada yang bingung, tenang labnya masih saya bagikan.
Pada lab ini saya asumsikan:
Domain induk = sibunglon.com Subdomain = blog.sibunglon.com master konfigurasi berada di direktori /sibunglonlabs/config/nginx File konfigurasi domain induk sibunglonlabs.</description>

        <description>Jika anda menggunakan VM Red Hat versi lama di Microsoft Azure, kadang anda mendapatkan masalah “SSL peer rejected your certificate as expired” jika ingin menginstall paket baru ataupun mengupate paket-paket. Itu terjadi karena sertifikat repositori sudah kadaluarsa, untuk memecahkan masalah tersebut cukup gunakan command
yum update -y --disablerepo=* --enablerepo=rhui-microsoft-* rhui-azure-rhel7
Setelah itu sekarang anda dapat menginstall atau update paket di Red Hat anda seperti yang biasa kamu lakukan.</description>

Salah satunya yaitu memidahkan direktori root html nginx. Di nginx, untuk memindahkan direktori root html dan memidahkan konfigurasinya cukup dengan command-command berikut.
Pada Lab ini saya asumsikan :
master konfigurasi berada di direktori /sibunglonlabs/config/nginx direktori root berada di /sibunglonlabs/web 1) Gunakan command berikut untuk memindahkan master konfig nginx ke direktori yang anda ingin, yang mudah diakses oleh anda namun susah ditemui oleh orang lain.</description>

Untuk mengizinkan trafik protokol HTTP, gunakan command
firewall-cmd --permanent --zone=public --add-service=http Sedangkan untuk mengizinkan trafik protokol HTTPS, gunakan command
firewall-cmd --permanent --zone=public --add-service=https Setelah diizinkan, firewall wajib direload agar update firewall dapat diterapkan</description>

Nginx, banyak orang membicarakannya meskipun salah dipelafalannya. Dulu saya juga salah melafakannya namun setelah diruqyah sama m1m1n atau yang dikenal dengan Andy Hidayat, sekarang gak salah pelafalan lagi :D .

        <description>Pengertian HTTPS juga disebut HTTP melalui TLS, HTTP melalui SSL, dan HTTP Secure adalah protokol untuk komunikasi yang aman melalui jaringan komputer yang banyak digunakan di Internet. HTTPS terdiri dari komunikasi melalui Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) dalam koneksi yang terenkripsi dengan Transport Layer Security atau pendahulunya Secure Sockets Layer. Fungsi utama untuk HTTPS adalah autentikasi dari website yang dikunjungi dan perlindungan privasi dan integritas data yang dipertukarkan. SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) adalah teknologi keamanan standar untuk membangun link yang dienkripsi antara web server dan browser.</description>

        <description>Dalam dunia internet, komputer saling berkomunikasi dengan mengenali ip addressnya. Namun karena manusia jauh lebih sulit mengingat angka-angkanya maka solusinya menggunakan DNS Server.
DNS yaitu kepanjangan dari Domain Name System merupakan sebuah server yang berfungsi menangani translasi penamaan host-host kedalam IP Address, begitu juga sebaliknya dalam menangani translasi dari IP Address ke Hostname/Domain. Lebih mudahnya DNS dapat diartikan sebagai sebuah layanan yang digunakan untuk menterjemahkan hostname/domain ke IP Address atau sebaliknya.</description>
